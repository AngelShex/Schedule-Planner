# Schedule-Planner-Challenge

## Repository Name 
The name of this website is called Work Day Scheduler a place where anyone can leave reminders of events happening on a normal work day nine am to five pm. A discription on this site can be if anyone who needs to log what plans they have throughout their work day are able to see which events have pasted, are happening, or, ones that are coming up. In the text box time filed once you leave an event and click the save button located on the right side that event will be saved to the webpage for keeping until being viewed again. 

### Usage 
This site can be used for people that have a compacted work schedule and would like to have their events that they need to log throughout their work day saved on this website from the times 9am to 5pm a normal work day.
